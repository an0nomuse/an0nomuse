Howdy, welcome to my github. I first made it to imbed ruffle into swf files for a website, but then realised a lot of programmers, CAD devs and modders
dump their code here, and I can post my stupid code here, to github, to bolster my resume!

My interests are videogames and robotics, and related defense things, like cyber defense, and robots for personal protection.
Like, most people can't own firearms for self defense, not just in countries with no second ammendment, but felons can't own them.
People like that need some form of protection, and that's probably going to be my lifes work. I hope to make it pocket size, recharging,
and non lethal.
I also want to make videogames, specifically superhero ones.
I'll post my stuff here, let this whole thing serve as my resume, and work towards my goals. Thanks for reading, if you have questions, just send an email to
